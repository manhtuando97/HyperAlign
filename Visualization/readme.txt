This folder contains the results in which the disparity scale between the two input hypergraphs are varied.
The methods considered here are: HyperAlign, HyperAlign-WA, HyperAlign-WC, HyperAlign-WAC (the variants of HyperAlign), and WAlign, the strongest competitor.
These results validate the contributions of the two modules: Contrastive Learning and Topological Augmentation to the performance when the scale disparity between the two input hypergraphs increases. 
File 'varying_Configuration_1.png' corresponds to Configuration 1 and supplements Figure 2 of the main paper.
File 'varying_Configuration_2.png' corresponds to Configuration 2 and supplements Figure 4 of the main paper.
